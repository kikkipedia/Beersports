# BEERSPORTS

This application is a game for random pub hopping in Gothenburg by tram, built using React and [VÃ¤sttrafik Resrobot API](https://www.trafiklab.se/api/resrobot-sok-resa/dokumentation-resrobot-sok-resa-0). Also my first project using Redux.

## Project Status

This project is currently in development. Moving from class based compomnents towards functional components using Redux. A working, but buggy, version was deployed [here](https://beersports666.firebaseapp.com/) in 2020.
